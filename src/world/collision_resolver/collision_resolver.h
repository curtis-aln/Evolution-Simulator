/* Collision Resolver Class
This class handles collision detection and resolution between particles in a 2D simulation. 
It uses a spatial grid to efficiently detect potential collisions and resolves them based on their positions and velocities.
Modify the Settings struct to change the grid size, cell capacity, and collision resolution parameters.
