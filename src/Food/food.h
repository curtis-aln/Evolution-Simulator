/* FoodManager

Food:
Reproduction:
When a food is born it can only reproduce when
1. its age surpasses the reproductive_threshold
2. it hasnt reproduced in a specified amount of frames (reproductive_cooldown)
3. The world food limit hasnt already been reached
- The chance of a food spawning is proportional to how much food there is in the world,
the more food there is the less chance there is for a new one to spawn.
- Every food item gets an opportunity to reproduce
- when a new food is made, it is spawned near its parent

Death:
- Food has a chance to die every frame after it reaches a certain age (death_age)
- it can also die by beng eaten by a protozoa

Nutrition:
- Every food starts with a certain amount of nutrients (initial_nutrients)
- Every frame the nutrients increase by a certain amount until they reach a maximum (final_nutrients)
- The nutrients of a food are what the protozoa gain when they eat it
